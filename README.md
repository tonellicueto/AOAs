# AOAs
In this repository, we provide almost-orthogonal arrays (AOAs) constructed through algebraic construction (AC), integer programming (IP) and two-staged local search (TS). An extra folder with previously constructed arrays (EXT) is also provided for comparisson. See the paper () for more details.
